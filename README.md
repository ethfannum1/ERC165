## ERC165



ERC165 is an interface to check if a contract supports an interface, it's a meta-interface so to say. 

This is useful if we want to interact with a contract but we don't know if it supports an interface such as ERC20 or ERC721.

As you can guess supportsInterface for ERC165 returns true.
